# Probability

P(A) is the probability of an event “A” n(A) is the number of favourable outcomes. n(S) is the total number of events in the sample space.

Conditional Probability	P(A | B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)

The best example for understanding probability is flipping a coin:
There are two possible outcomes—heads or tails.
What’s the probability of the coin landing on Heads? 
We can find out using the equation P(H) = ?P(H)=?P, left parenthesis, H, right parenthesis, equals, question mark.
You might intuitively know that the likelihood is half/half, or 50%.  But how do we work that out?  
P(A) = (# of ways A can happen) / (Total number of outcomes) 
P(A) = 1/2
